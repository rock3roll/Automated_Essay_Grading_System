#Automated Essay Grading and Feedback System
<p>This project focuses on Automated Essay Grading by creating an AI tool that provides instant grading and constructive feedback on students' essays. </p>
<p>This tool helps free up teachers' time for more personalized teaching and reduces subjective bias in scoring. </p>
<p>Using Machine Learning models and NLTK for text transformation, the backend is built with Flask. </p>
<p>Users can upload multiple text files containing essays, which are processed through the Flask framework. </p>
<p>The results, including filename, grade, and feedback, are displayed in a tabular format on result.html and appended to a CSV file for record-keeping.</p>
